# Logistic Regression Music Genre Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying music genres using a custom implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm. The project is structured into two main components: feature extraction and model training & evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- librosa
- matplotlib (optional, for plotting loss during training)

### Feature Extraction
Before training the model, features must be extracted from audio files. This is done using the `data_processor.py` script. To execute feature extraction, modify the file paths to your training and testing datasets within the script as shown below, then run the script.

Modify these lines in data_processor.py to point to your data directories
process_dataset_for_training('path/to/your/training_data')
process_dataset_for_testing('path/to/your/testing_data')


### Model Training and Evaluation
Once the features are extracted and saved as CSV files, the model can be trained using the train.py script. Before running the script, make sure the paths to the pre-extracted feature CSV files are correctly set. 

Modify these lines in train.py to use your feature CSV files
train_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/train_features.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/test_features.csv')

The script will train the Logistic Regression model, evaluate its performance, and save the predictions to a CSV file.

### LogisticRegression Class
The core of the project is the LogisticRegression class, which encapsulates the logistic regression algorithm. It offers functionality to fit the model to training data, make predictions on new data, and evaluate the model's accuracy.

### Running the Scripts
To run the feature extraction script:
python data_processor.py

To train the model and generate predictions:
python train.py

This will show the cross validation accuracy as well as create a prediction file which can be submitted in the Kaggle to check accuracy.

### Contributions
Manjil - Wrote the code for the gradient descent function and also worked on finding the best combination of features that would yield the highest level of accuracy. Worked on the train.py file implementing the PCA, model training, prediction code, and evaluation part of the code. Worked on the report and contributed the Logistic Regression and Performance and Evaluation part of the report. 

Vincent - Worked on the Logistic Regression code by applying Manjilâ€™s code on gradient descent and softmax. Functions include fit, predict, and evaluate. Researched appropriate features for genre classification and worked on Feature Extraction both in the code and in the report. Worked on expanding the dataset by trying multiple methods but was later discarded due to reduction in accuracy. 

Erick - Conducted research on spectral features and their potential relevance in genre classification. Worked on an early version of extracting these features which was later integrated into the completed data_processing file. Briefly worked on implementing KFold random_state, however, as it did not render accuracy improvements it was discarded. Worked on gradient descent, PCA, optimizations, and standardization in the report.

Abhinav - Researched librosa techniques and worked on processing data and feature extraction. Also, worked on sectioning of the songs and recombining sections from the same genre to see if they produced better results with more data points. For experiments, worked on applying different sampling rates for the whole songs and different hop rates to find the most accurate method. In the report, worked on the introduction, extracting information, results, and conclusion.
